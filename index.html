          <h2>Who is Louby?</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my website! I'm Louby, an educator and tech enthusiast currently working in the Gaming Industry. After leaving my teaching career, I pursued my passion for gaming and landed a job as an Operations Analyst at Electronic Arts (EA), one of the leading companies in the industry. I'm proud to be a part of EA's major studio, Respawn Entertainment, where I train newly hired Quality Assurance (QA) Testers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally from Southern Louisiana, I'm still based in the vibrant Acadiana region. While I cherish my roots, my high school sweetheart and I are open to new experiences and are willing to relocate for opportunities that come our way. Exploring different cultures through travel is something I absolutely adore.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey as an instructor began in 2014 at a local Italian fine dining restaurant, where I started as a line cook and quickly progressed to the role of Training Specialist. Concurrently, I pursued my Bachelor's Degree in Education at the University of Louisiana. This combination of practical training experience and academic knowledge laid the foundation for my career in shaping young minds and creating engaging learning experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my years as a classroom teacher, I honed essential soft skills such as effective communication and leadership, which have greatly contributed to my success as a trainer. As a lifelong learner, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise. I thrive on designing innovative learning solutions, utilizing the latest proven technologies. Whether it's developing websites like the one you're currently browsing or creating materials to enhance content delivery, I find immense joy in blending my passion for learning with my insatiable interest in technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to reach out to me to learn more about my work and how I can assist you. I'm excited about what the future holds and the possibilities that lie ahead with EA.

                I designed this ecommerce website for a local small business owner and helped to dramatically 
                increase sale volume by roughly 300% by creating a user friendly and straight-forward design 
                for the customer to sell their products nationally without prior communication.

          That’s been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex; you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.
