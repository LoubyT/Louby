          <h2>Who is Louby?</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there - thanks for landing on my website! I'm Louby, an Educator and a tech geek 
            currently residing in the Acadiana region of the United States. 
            I was born here in Southern Louisiana and married my high school sweetheart. 
            We are currently raising our two children here in Acadiana but we are both open to moving 
            and experiencing life from a different lense. I love traveling especially when I am 
            able to immerse myself in a new culture. I am actively seeking a role as a corporate trainer so 
            that I may use my existing skillset to venture into a new and exciting learning journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been training adults and teaching children from all walks of life for nearly a 
            decade now. My journey as an instructor began in 2014 when I was hired at a local Italian 
            fine dining restaurant as a line cook and was then quickly promoted to Training Specialist.
            I spent years here training new hires while studying at the University of Louisiana to earn 
            my Bachelor's Degree in Education. Today, I help mould the young minds of the newest generation 
            by combining my years of studying best educational practices and expertise in creating engaging 
            learning experiences. I am lucky to have been able to develop and practice vital soft skills 
            that are key to being a successful trainer, such as communication and leadership, thanks to 
            being a classroom teacher for the past few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a firm believer of life-long learning. On that note, I'm constantly seeking out opportunities 
            to grow and develop. I love designing learning solutions using the newest and most proven effective 
            innovative technology. From developing websites like the one you're currently browsing to crafting 
            materials that help deliver my content more successfully, I thrive whenever I am able to combine 
            my passion for learning with my insatiable interest in technology. Contact me to learn more!

                I designed this ecommerce website for a local small business owner and helped to dramatically 
                increase sale volume by roughly 300% by creating a user friendly and straight-forward design 
                for the customer to sell their products nationally without prior communication.

          That’s been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex; you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.
